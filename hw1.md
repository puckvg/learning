## Python Continous Integration 

Assignment: Use the following tools to make a CI pipeline for your Python GitHub project

Many CI DevOps tools exists, since you are working on GitHub, use
- GitHub Actions

Google the purpose of the following python tools
- isort
- flake8
- autoflake
- black
- mypy
- autolint
- pytest


Use the tools to

- Always test code on commit to GitHub
- Always test lint on commit to GitHub
- Always in-force format on commit

Never accept code in your codebase that is not formatted in a defined style and fails unittests.
This becomes especially important when working with others, and rules like these makes it easier to collaborate.
